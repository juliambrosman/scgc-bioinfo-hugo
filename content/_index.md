# **Bioinformatics of Microbial Single Cells**


***A course hosted by the Single Cell Genomics Center and Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences***

*With SAG data becoming more complex, and with advances in SCG technology that allow us to routinely sequence hundreds of cells at a time at low coverage, SCGC recognizes a need for knowledge of programming, data science and bioinformatic tools to be able to interpret these data.  This is where the SCGC Bioinformatics Course comes in.  This course will cover methods for the generation and analysis of single cell genomes.*

**Instructors:** Ramunas Stepanauskas, Julia Brown, Maria Pachiadaki, Joe Brown and Florian Trigodet

**Intended Audience:** Faculty, graduate students, post docs and industry professionals interested in learning about and working with SAG data.


**What participants will learn:**

* What goes into generating a SAG at SCGC
* How to access, organize and interpret SAG data and default SCGC analyses
* Techniques for analyzing single cell data

This will be a 5-day workshop held at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences from October 12-16, 2020.  There will be an optional software carpentry workshop covering computing basics and useful software carpentry methods held immediately preceding this workshop on October 8th and 9th, 2020.
